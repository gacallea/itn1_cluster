# ITN1 Cluster #

Hereby you find my second humble contribution to the [Cardano](https://www.cardano.org/en/home/) ecosystem. I hope that it can be helpful to you. Enjoy :)

## ITN1 Cluster Guide ##

The ```ITN1 Cluster``` guide helps you install and configure a Cardano ITN1 clustered Pool with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It also introduces the script that will help you manage and automate it. You can find it [here](https://guides.insalada.io/#/ITN1_CLUSTER).

## About Me ###

Should you be wondering about my technical background, [I've been a Linux professional](https://linkedin.com/in/gacallea/) for a long time. I love Open Source, and I've taught people about it. I strongly believe in Cardano. And it was a long time since I last contributed to a project.

I also run the [**Insalada Stake Pool**](https://insalada.io/), and this is what got me into this adventure. Follow [**insaladaPool**](https://twitter.com/insaladaPool) on Twitter for updates.
