Hereby you find my second humble contribution to the [Cardano](https://www.cardano.org/en/home/) ecosystem. I hope that it can be helpful to you. Enjoy :)

**IMPORTANT**: the guide and the scripts are written for the current Cardano node architecture, and will be updated and adapted to the newly announced [Haskell version](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/02/12/new-cardano-node-explorer-backend-and-web-api-released/), as soon as our pool will have migrated to it and tested.

**IMPORTANT**: check back **often** for updates for both the scripts and the guide, as they are constantly improved and updated.

## Guide ##

The ```ITN1 Cluster``` guide helps you install and configure a Cardano ITN1 clustered Pool. It also introduces the script that will help you manage and automate it. [Read on](ITN1_CLUSTER.md) for detailed instructions.

## About Me ###

Should you be wondering about my technical background, [I've been a Linux professional](https://linkedin.com/in/gacallea/) for a long time. I love Open Source, and I've taught people about it. I strongly believe in Cardano. And it was a long time since I last contributed to a project.

I also run the [**Insalada Stake Pool**](https://insalada.io/), and this is what got me into this adventure. Follow [**insaladaPool**](https://twitter.com/insaladaPool) on Twitter for updates.

## Contributions ##

If you have comments, changes, suggestions for the guide and/or the scripts, please [file an issue](https://github.com/gacallea/itn1_cluster/issues) on Github. Any insight is valuable and will be considered for integration and improvements.

If these resources help you in any way, consider [buying me a beer](https://seiza.com/blockchain/address/Ae2tdPwUPEZ5dQJi1LU2Df2tN8Qhxa5fxRL27uPPjWdLfkGXHniCLBcdzAH). Delegating [to my pool](https://insalada.io/) would also be nice.
